# Pyxel Playground: A Web-Based Game Editor

I've created a browser-based editor for making retro games with [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), a Python retro game engine. It lets you code and play simple games right in your browser.

You can try it live here: [Pyxel Playground](/games/pyxel-playground.html)
