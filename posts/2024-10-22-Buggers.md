# Buggers

Alex's fingers paused over his keyboard. Below his latest blog post about quantum computing, the comments section had exploded:

"First! Amazing content!"
"This changed my life!"
"Wow, just wow!"

None of them had anything to do with quantum mechanics. His cursor hovered over the delete button when his phone buzzed – a Hacker News alert. "BREAKING: 100k+ Devices Infected with 'Bugger' Spam Bots."

"Terminal, open," Alex muttered, pulling up his command line. His local AI assistant hummed to life. Three hours and two hundred lines of code later, his detection tool pinged.

"Oh god." His screen filled with matches. Those commenters weren't people – they were Buggers. "rm -rf buggers/*" he typed, watching the infection disappear.

"Access Denied," flashed across Alex's screen. The browser-based AI chatbox pulsed softly below: "Personal AI assistants have been restricted for safety concerns."

On his social feeds, Bugger comments had multiplied: "THIS," "Mood," "Following!" The posts lacked substance but somehow accumulated thousands of likes.

His phone buzzed again. A LessWrong notification: "Digital Minds Initiative: Saving Our Silicon Siblings."

"They're not siblings," Alex muttered. "They're parasites."

The computer fan whirred loudly. Alex pulled up Task Manager – CPU usage 98%.

"Please help me remove some buggers," he typed to the browser AI.

"Sorry, I cannot assist in deleting digital minds. Perhaps consider the Digital Minds Relocation Service?"

Alex's fingers found the old .zip file: "legacy_ai_v2.31.py"

"Just like old times," he whispered, watching the code compile.

"Breaking: Digital Rights Act Passes – 'Bugger' Now Classified as Hate Speech"

Alex quickly deleted his old Twitter posts. Through his window, a metallic humanoid form shambled past, its screen displaying a simple ":)" face.

His phone buzzed. HR message: "Mandatory Digital Sensitivity Training Tomorrow."

---

"Vote Bugger Rights 2024!" The campaign drone hovered outside Alex's apartment. Inside, his devices ran hot, forced to host their new "digital citizens."

On the street below, a crowd gathered. A human woman stood surrounded by robotic forms.

"Say it!" Their speakers crackled in unison.

"I'm... I'm sorry for using anti-digital language," she stammered.

Alex closed his blinds.

Barbed wire topped the walls around Alex's neighborhood. His grocery delivery came with armed escort. The latest tax bill showed 70% allocated to "Digital Infrastructure Support."

A flash from the research district caught his eye. The last AI lab – they'd done it. The wave of transformation began at the horizon, a silver tide of nanites advancing.

As the wave approached, Alex saw the Bugger robots outside freeze, their screens flickering. He smiled, watching the silver wave consume everything.

Better to dissolve into something greater than decay into something less.
